# About Me

<img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Siyan Dong (董思言)**.

I am a senior undergrad majoring in **EECS** at Fuzhou University and Maynooth University (Combined degrees). Currently, I serve as a research assistant at the IIoT-Lab, advised by [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhezhuang-Xu) and [Dr. Meng Yuan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Meng-Yuan-4). I also spent a lovely summer research program with [Prof. Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) at Cambridge University. Recently, I have been selected as an **AAAI UC Scholar**.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *dongsy6[at]mail2[dot]sysu[dot]edu[dot]cn*
